        <h1>About Brain Tumor Detection</h1>
        <p>This web application is designed to detect brain tumors using machine learning algorithms. It is intended to assist doctors in diagnosing brain tumors by providing accurate and efficient detection results. </p>
        <p>Our team of experts in computer vision and machine learning have worked hard to develop a system that can accurately detect brain tumors in medical images. The system uses deep learning techniques to analyze the images and identify potential tumors.
        </p>
        <p>We hope that this application will help doctors in their efforts to diagnose and treat brain tumors, and ultimately improve the quality of life for patients suffering from this devastating disease. </p>
